  <h1>My personal life</h1>
  
  <p>
    I currently live in Sturbridge, MA with my wife of 8 years. I commute to
    Norwood every day. Right now, between work, school, and commuting I'm a 
    bit busy, but when I do have time I like any sort of nature activities, 
    reading, watching tv, and spending time with friends. One of my favorite 
    things to do is traveling. I've been to Europe and Latin America before 
    and lived in Thailand for 2 years. Originally, I wanted to teach English
    internationally and move from country to country, but I found the management
    side of teaching to be too stressful (both in the classroom as well as 
    bureacracy) so I decided to take my career in a more technical direction. 
    Learning computer science has been really enjoyable so far. I try to treat
    my studying as a hobby, and a chance to improve myself as a human being 
    rather than just a means to an end. Its a good chance to practice deeper 
    focusing, time management, finding ways to learn things on my own, memory
    techniques etc. I am not always the most creative person but I am looking 
    forward to exercising my creativity muscles now in <abbr title= "Computer Science 601- 
    Intro to Web Development">CS601!</abbr>
