  <h1>My career</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently a CS student at BU. So far, I've taken classes in computer
    architecture, operating systems, data structures w/ C++, and algorithms. I
    think my goal for now is to do web development at my company. They have 
    many internal web applications, for which I've now been an end user for many
    years. I've long appreciated how these apps abstract away a lot of work from
    users like me, and how they help maintain data integrity. Furthermore, I 
    find them a pleasure to use! I think as a long term end user I can help add 
    to this user experience in the future. I do enjoy listening to people and 
    what their needs are as well as the technical aspects of computers and coding. 
    I have always been interested in Math and languages so I do enjoy the logic of 
    coding but I haven't always been as knowledgable about computers. Between 
    work and school I've learned alot in the past year. In general, I'm a curious
    person and hope that as a software developer I'll always have opportunities
    to learn new things as I find this very motivating at work.
