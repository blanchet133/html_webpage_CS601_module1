    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Thank you for stopping by. This is a prototype webpage about me... Mike Blanchet. 
      It currently resembles classic 90s sites that we remember fondly like   
      <a title="nostalgia" href="https://www.tic.com/" target= "_blank"> this</a>
      and 
      <a title="nostalgia" href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/" target= "_blank"> this</a>
      . It should evolve into something more modern looking as I learn more in CS601!
    </p>
